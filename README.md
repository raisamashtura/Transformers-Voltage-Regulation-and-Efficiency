## Transformers-Voltage-Regulation-and-Efficiency
<br>Course: Numerical Technique Laboratory</br>
<br>Supervisor: I.K.M Reaz Rahman</br> 
Parameters of a three-phase or single-phase transformer were obtained using GUI and plots of voltage regulation, efficiency against load as well as the equivalent circuit were displayed on the GUI window. Simulation was carried out using MATLAB.
